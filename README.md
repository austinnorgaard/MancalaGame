# MancalaGame

## Advanced Data Structures Final

  I created this game for my ADS Final and it is programmed in Java with a couple lines of CSS. The intent
was to create a fully working and well-coded computer version of mancala. I went ahead and added extra features
such as the rules page, a main menu, and even background music with a toggle option at the menu. I may add this
toggle to the game screen as well, however I kind of like where it is now. All of this was done myself, however
there was assistance as far as critique from my professor.

Thank you and enjoy :)
